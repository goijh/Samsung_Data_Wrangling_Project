# Samsung_Data_Wrangling_Project
Data Wrangling Project for Springboard's Foundations in Data Science Program. Uses R's dplyr and tidyr packages to cleans and summarise multiple datasets from experiments conducted using Samsung Galaxy SII's

#Library Dependencies

1. dplyr - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/README.html

2. tidyr - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/README.html

#Requirements:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts columns containing mean and standard deviation for each measurement (Hint: Since some feature/column names are repeated, you may need to use the make.names() function in R)

3. Creates variables called ActivityLabel and ActivityName that label all observations with the corresponding activity labels and names respectively

4. From the data set in step 3, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
