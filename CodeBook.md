#Wrangling the Data
1. Download the Samsung datasets (like in readme.md)
2. Import test and train datasets to RStudio as well as activity_labels.txt and features.txt
3. Use the dplyr package and names() function to combine the datasets and label the variables and activity types accordingly (see comments in run_analysis.R for more detail)
4. Tidy the data by selecting only variables which include mean or standard deviation (std) data
5. Group the slimmed dataset by subject and activity and summarise each subject's mean data

#Key Variables
mean_std_data - data frame of mean and std related variables for combined datasets
summary_data - data frame and grouped and summarized observations
